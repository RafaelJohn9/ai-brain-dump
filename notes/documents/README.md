# Document Search

Imagine you're a legal researcher needing to quickly find precedents in a 1000-page law book, or a medical professional searching for the latest treatment protocols in a massive clinical guideline. How do you ensure you get the most relevant, accurate, and concise information—fast?

This directory tackles the challenge: **How can we efficiently and accurately query huge documents to retrieve and summarize the information that matters most?** We benchmark cutting-edge methods to see which ones truly deliver in high-stakes, real-world scenarios.

## Exercises

Try these hands-on Jupyter Notebook exercises to simulate real-world document search and summarization challenges:

1. **Legal Case Retrieval**  
    - Load a multi-page legal document.
    - Use different embedding models to find cases matching a specific legal scenario.
    - Compare retrieval accuracy and speed.

2. **Medical Protocol Search**  
    - Implement bi-encoder and cross-encoder methods to answer clinical questions.
    - Test effectiveness on factual vs. contextual queries.

3. **News Archive Exploration**  
    - Index news articles with vector databases.
    - Retrieve relevant stories about a breaking event and measure latency.

4. **Research Paper Q&A (RAG)**  
    - Use retrieval-augmented generation to answer complex research questions.
    - Evaluate generated answers against direct search results.

5. **Executive Summary Generation**  
    - Apply extractive and abstractive summarization to lengthy reports.
    - Assess summaries for coverage and clarity.

6. **Performance Metrics Dashboard**  
    - Measure precision, recall, and response time for each method.
    - Visualize which approaches excel under pressure.

These exercises put document search and summarization methods to the test—helping you discover which techniques are best for high-impact, real-world applications.
