# Document Search

This directory is dedicated to solving the problem: **How accurately and efficiently can we query a 1000-page book and retrieve relevant results?** In addition to search, we also focus on summarizing content to provide concise overviews of what a document is about and its nature.

We will explore and benchmark various approaches, including:

- Embeddings (various models and techniques)
- Encoders (bi-encoders, cross-encoders)
- Vector databases and indexing strategies
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Query optimization and ranking algorithms
- Summarization techniques for extracting key information and document intent
- Evaluation metrics for accuracy and speed

Our goal is to identify and implement methods that provide both high accuracy and fast retrieval times for large-scale document search and summarization tasks.
